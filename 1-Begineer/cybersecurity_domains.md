# 🔐 Introduction to Cybersecurity
Cybersecurity is a vast field with many different areas or domains. Each domain focuses on a specific part of protecting computers, networks, and data. This guide explains the main cybersecurity domains in simple language.

---

## 1. 🛡️ **Red Team**

- Role: Attackers or ethical hackers who simulate real-world attacks on systems to find vulnerabilities.

- Goal: Find weaknesses before the bad guys do.

- Activities: Penetration testing, social engineering, exploit development.

- Tools: Metasploit, Nmap, Burp Suite, Kali Linux.

---

## 2. 🛡️ **Blue Team**

- Role: Defenders who protect systems from attacks.

- Goal: Monitor networks, detect intrusions, respond to threats.

- Activities: Security monitoring, incident response, log analysis, patch management.

- Tools: SIEM (Splunk, ELK), IDS/IPS, firewalls.

---

## 3. 🟣 **Purple Team**

- Role: A mix of Red and Blue teams working together.

- Goal: Improve security by sharing knowledge between attackers and defenders.

- Activities: Collaborative testing and defense strategies.

---

## 4. 🖥️ **Security Operations Center (SOC)**

- Role: The team or facility that monitors and responds to security incidents 24/7.

- Goal: Quickly detect and respond to cyber threats.

- Activities: Alert monitoring, incident management, forensic analysis.

---

## 5. 🔍 **Threat Intelligence**

- Role: Collect and analyze information about current and emerging threats.

- Goal: Predict and prevent attacks by understanding attacker behavior.

- Activities: Research hacker tactics, gather data from dark web, create threat reports.

---

## 6. 🕵️‍♂️ **Forensics**

- Role: Investigate cybercrimes and security breaches.

- Goal: Recover data, trace attacker actions, provide evidence.

- Activities: Data recovery, malware analysis, chain of custody.

---

## 7. 🔑 **Identity and Access Management (IAM)**

- Role: Manage user identities and control access to systems.

- Goal: Ensure only authorized users can access resources.

- Activities: User authentication, role management, multi-factor authentication.

---

## 8. 🛠️ **Security Architecture and Engineering**

- Role: Design and build secure IT systems.

- Goal: Embed security into hardware, software, and networks from the start.

- Activities: Risk assessment, security design, implementing controls.

---

## 9. 📜 **Compliance and Governance**

- Role: Ensure organizations follow security laws and regulations.

- Goal: Avoid legal penalties and maintain trust.

- Activities: Audits, policy creation, compliance reporting.

---

## 10. 💻 **Application Security**

- Role: Protect software applications from vulnerabilities.

- Goal: Secure apps against attacks like SQL injection, XSS, etc.

- Activities: Code review, secure coding practices, penetration testing.

---

## 11. 🌐 **Network Security**

- Role: Protect data moving across networks.

- Goal: Prevent unauthorized access and attacks.

- Activities: Firewall configuration, VPNs, intrusion detection.
