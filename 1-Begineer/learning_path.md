# 🚀 Where to Start in Cybersecurity (Complete Beginner Guide)

If you are new to cybersecurity, it can feel confusing. But don't worry — this guide explains exactly where to begin, what to learn, and in which order.

## 🎯 What Is Cybersecurity?

Cybersecurity means protecting computers, networks, and data from attacks or unauthorized access.

Examples:
- Preventing someone from stealing your Facebook password
- Blocking malware from entering your computer
- Securing websites from hackers

## 🧱 Step 1: Learn Basic Computer and Operating System Concepts

Before diving into hacking or security, you must understand how computers and operating systems work.

### ✅ What you should learn:
- What is an Operating System (OS)?
- What are files, processes, users, and permissions?
- Difference between Windows and Linux
- Folder structures in Linux (`/etc`, `/home`, `/var`, etc.)

📘 Resources:
- [How to install virtual machine](VM-Installation/README.md)
- [Basic linux commands](Basic-Linux-commands-for-beginner's.pdf)
- [Useful linux tools](useful_linux_tools.md)

💡 **Practice Tip:**  
Use a Virtual Machine (VM) like **Kali Linux** inside **VirtualBox**. It’s safer and easy to reset if things go wrong.

---

## 🌐 Step 2: Learn Networking Basics

Most hacking attacks happen over networks, so understanding how networks work is very important.

### ✅ Topics to cover:
- What is an IP address?
- What are ports and protocols (HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SSH)?
- What is DNS and how websites are resolved?
- What is a firewall and how does it protect systems?

📘 Resource:
- [Basic Networking](Networking_basics.md)

💡 **Practice Tip:**  
Use the `ping`, `traceroute`, and `netstat` commands in Linux to explore networks.

---

## 🧰 Step 3: Learn About Cybersecurity Tools

Now that you know Linux and networking basics, start using basic cybersecurity tools.

### ✅ Tools to explore:
- **Nmap** – For network scanning
- **Wireshark** – For analyzing network traffic
- **Burp Suite** – For web application testing
- **Dirb / Gobuster** – For directory brute-forcing
- **Netcat** – For port listening and reverse shells

📘 Resource:
- [Useful Linux Tools](useful_linux_tools.md)

💡 **Practice Tip:**  
Try scanning your own VM using Nmap from another VM.

## 🏁 Step 4: Practice on Beginner-Friendly Platforms

Now it’s time to use what you’ve learned. Start solving real-world problems using CTF platforms.

### ✅ Recommended Platforms:
- [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/) – Very beginner-friendly, with learning paths
- [PicoCTF](https://picoctf.org/) – Game-based challenges, great for students
- [Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.com/) – Good for intermediate learners

💡 **Start with TryHackMe Rooms:**
- Introduction to Cybersecurity
- Linux Fundamentals
- Web Fundamentals

## 🔐 Step 5: Learn Basic Attacks and Defenses

Start reading about common types of cyber attacks. Focus on **understanding**, not performing them.

### ✅ Learn about:
- Phishing
- Brute-force attacks
- SQL Injection (SQLi)
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Denial of Service (DoS)

💡 **Don’t try these on real websites!** Always use safe labs and virtual machines.

---

## 🧠 Step 6: Build Your Knowledge Over Time

Cybersecurity is a huge field. Start slowly and keep improving.

### ✅ Extra things to learn:
- Learn Python or Bash scripting (used in automation)
- Understand logs and incident response
- Explore ethical hacking, SOC, VAPT, and bug bounty
- Follow security news and YouTube channels

---

## 📚 Keep a Personal Notebook or GitHub Repo

Make a folder for your notes. Example:

cyber-notes/\
├── linux/\
├── networking/\
├── tools/\
├── web-attacks/\
├── ctf-writeups/

 `Share your progress on GitHub or LinkedIn --- it helps in interviews and learning.

---
## ✅ Final Advice

- Be **consistent**, not fast. 1 hour daily > 10 hours once a month.
- Be **curious** --- if you don't understand something, search it.
- Don't fear failure --- **mistakes help you learn.**
- Never stop practicing.
